# Contribution guidelines

## Licensing of contributions

By submitting a contribution, you agree that it may be distributed
under the project's dual-license terms: the Apache License, Version 2.0
and the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full legal terms.

## Code signing

Contributors are encouraged to cryptographically sign their work,
such as Git commits and tags. This practice verifies authenticity
and protects the project's integrity. GPG and SSH keys are the
recommended methods for signing contributions.

## Contributor recognition

Contributors are warmly invited to add their names to the
[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file, whether contributing
through code, documentation, testing, or community support.

## Identity policy

This project respects a contributor's right to choose the identity
under which they make contributions. Contributors are not required
to use their legal or birth name. A consistent username, pseudonym,
or real name may be used, provided it is not used to misrepresent
authorship or impersonate another person.

To maintain the integrity and trust of the project, the following
principles apply:

- **No misrepresentation:** Contributions must be attributable to a
  consistent identity within the project. Identities must not be
  false, misleading, or used to impersonate another person or
  entity.

- **Authorship continuity:** A contributor's identity should allow
  the community to recognize and attribute their contributions.
  Maintaining consistent authorship upholds trust, accountability,
  and the long-term integrity of the project.

- **Intellectual property and legal compliance:** Contributors must
  not use their chosen identity to conceal unlawful actions,
  misappropriate intellectual property, or evade legal, licensing,
  or contractual obligations applicable to their contributions.
  Any such misuse undermines the project's integrity, the rights of
  all contributors, and harms those who contribute in good faith
  under a chosen identity.

- **Communication and accountability:** Each contributor must
  provide and maintain a reachable contact email address for
  project-related matters. This contact information will be used
  solely for project communication and governance purposes. In the
  event of a legal dispute, contributors are expected to assist in
  establishing the provenance of their contribution.

Noncompliance with this policy may result in rejection or removal of
contributions, suspension from the project, or other reasonable and
proportionate actions deemed necessary by the project maintainers to
protect the integrity of the project.

By submitting a contribution, the contributor affirms their
understanding of and adherence to this policy.

## The use of the Developer's Certificate of Origin

This project's application of the Developer's Certificate of Origin
aligns with established open source practices.

A sign-off is a statement appended to the end of a commit message,
certifying that a contributor is the original author of the
contributed work or has the legal authority to submit it under the
applicable open source license. The process is as follows: if a
contributor can make the following certification:

```plaintext
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then the contributor must include the following line in the commit
message:

```plaintext
Signed-off-by: Contributor Identity <email@example.com>
```

using a consistent identity that can be attributed to the
contributor within the project.
